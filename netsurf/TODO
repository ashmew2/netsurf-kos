A list of things that need to be done  :

Short Term:
Get POST working.
Determine the cause of 100% CPU usage and fluctuations and fix it.
Integrate with the Kolibri UI and fix bugs such as the Choose a File Dialog box for uploading content.
Update to a later Netsurf version
Handle Cookies in Netsurf
       
Medium Term:
Fix the build scripts and probably have a make.everything file to build everything from scratch in Netsurf (including libs).
Update to a newer version of netsurf so that things can stay more current.
Auto-build Netsurf from sources on KolibriOS build server.

Long Term:
Integrate with the Netsurf CI after UI is merged and we have a triple toolchain.
Add HTTPS Support (Incomplete Polar SSL C Port needs fixing first.)
